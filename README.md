# Problem-Bazaar

Search Engine to Search Competitive Programming Problems

Hosted App [Link](https://problem-bazaar.vercel.app/)

## Description

Welcome to Problem-Bazaar! This is a Competitive Programming Problems Searching App built using HTML, CSS, and Flask. It simplifies the process of finding problems on LeetCode and Codeforces, making it easy to search for problems based on specific criteria.

The app utilizes data from the LeetCode and Codeforces Problems Dataset, which is scraped using Selenium and Beautiful Soup. To improve the search experience, the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm has been implemented. I welcome your feedback and suggestions to make this app even better!

## Features

- **Efficient Problem Search:** Quickly find problems based on keywords, tags, or other specific criteria.

- **Data from Top Platforms:** Access problems from popular platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces.

- **Local Development:** Easily set up and run the app locally on your machine.
